AngularJS + RequireJS project seed
==================================

AngularJS + RequireJS HTML5 project example, could easily be used as a boilerplate.

## Why?

- Because AMD modules are great for re-usability and scalabilty
- Because we like browser errors like "syntaxError: missing X on ListControl.js (line 56, col 2)"
- Because we don't want to wait for a tool to build our application, who likes debugging combined javascript files anyway?
- Because AngularJS is not a prison and this application demonstrates the freedom you can get while staying organized


## What's inside

Tons of goodies and good practices for overall productivity, code robustness, rapid debugging and most of all keeping it simple as possible.

- Localization using the RequireJS i18n plugin for simplicity, see app/components/Localization.js
- A simple boot.js procedure triggered by RequireJS 
- Normalize.css from the HTML5Boilerplate

## No Less, No SASS?

Yes, it's up to you to decide, not me.

## Grunt tasks / tests are coming soon

Keep in mind that no build tool or watcher will be necessary to develop and debug the application, thanks to RequireJS.
