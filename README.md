AngularJS + RequireJS project seed
==================================

AngularJS + RequireJS HTML5 project example, could easily be used as a boilerplate.

## Why?

- Because AMD modules are great for code re-usability and application scalabilty
- Because we like browser errors like "syntaxError: missing X on ListControl.js (line 56, col 2)"
- Because AngularJS is great, but we want to use jQuery plugins and awesome HTML5 libraries.
This application demonstrates the freedom you can get while staying organized.
- Because we don't want to add a script tag for each controller nor manually manage js files, see [config.js](https://github.com/josimard/angular-requirejs-seed/blob/master/app/config.js).
- Because the [RequireJS Optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html) is our friend when it's time to make that build.
- Because we want to use [UglifyJS2](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) and keep injection rules working, without DI annotations.

##Installation

A first-time installation is necessary to get [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and it's related plugins. Also make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed and run this command from this project root folder:

    $ npm install

To install the latest Grunt depencencies
  
    $ npm install grunt-cli -g
    $ npm update --save

##Building the project

To generate an optimized build, [use Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) as usual

	$ grunt

A "dist" folder will be generated with a minified version of your app/js files and only the necessary dependencies to serve over HTTP. Feel free to modify the [Gruntfile.js](https://github.com/josimard/angular-requirejs-seed/blob/master/Gruntfile.js) to suit your needs.

Keep in mind that no build tool or build watcher is necessary to develop and debug your application. Simply open [app/index.html](https://github.com/josimard/angular-requirejs-seed/blob/master/app/index.html) and experience coding comfort. Thanks to [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/).


## Wiring AngularJS controllers 

To wire controllers in this rig it's a piece of cake:

- Register it's path in [config.js](https://github.com/josimard/angular-requirejs-seed/blob/master/app/config.js)

		angular: {
			controllers: [
				// Define AMD controllers first
				"js/controllers/MyControl",

				// Global scope controllers can be used, but must be listed after AMD ones
				"js/controllers/MyGlobalScopeControl"
			]
		}

- Use a string in your [routes](https://github.com/josimard/angular-requirejs-seed/blob/master/app/js/services/Routing.js) instead of linking with the functions directly:

		$routeProvider.when('path', {templateUrl: 'templates/yeah.html', controller: "MyControl"});


- Add the [@ngInject](https://github.com/josimard/angular-requirejs-seed#nginject-build-directive) build directive comment before controllers constructors.

		/** @ngInject */
		function MyControl($scope, $http)
		{
			
		}

- Controllers are parsed and registered in [app.js](https://github.com/josimard/angular-requirejs-seed/blob/master/app/app.js)


## Angular.js [Depencency Injection](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di) and minification

### The problem

Usually, your favorite minifier will change the attributes names to save space and AngularJS would not understand what to inject anymore, getting you into [trouble like this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16242406/angular-js-error-with-providerinjector). 

### UglifyJS2 angular pass

People at Google are clever and came up with [this solution](http://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/source/browse/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/AngularPass.java) for their Closure compiler. Inspired by this solution, a simple angularPass() is included. This is handled in the UglifyJS2 custom task of my [build utilities](https://github.com/josimard/angular-requirejs-seed/blob/master/tools/build-utils.js).

#### @ngInject build directive 

To add [dependency annotation](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di#dependency-annotation) automatically, you can flag your controllers contructors by adding the @ngInject directive: 

		/** @ngInject */		
		function MyController($scope, $http)
		{		
			
		}

Once [minified](https://github.com/josimard/angular-requirejs-seed/blob/master/Gruntfile.js), the previous code will not throw errors because $inject annotation will be pre-pended:
	
		MyController.$inject = ['$scope', '$http'];		
		function MyController(a, b)
		{		
			// a and b will not throw an error due to $inject
		}

#### Inline dependency injection

Normally, you could end up writing some hard-to-maintain declarations called [inline annotations](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di#inline-annotation)

		angular.module('app').controller("MyController", ["$scope", "$http", "Service1", "Service2"], function ($scope, $http, Service1, Service2) {
			// Yeah, rightâ€¦ what's this controller name yet?
		}]);

Now you can write normal directives, the build script is making use of [ng-annotate](https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate).

		angular.module('app').controller("MyController", function ($scope, $http, Service1, Service2) {
			// Not thats better
		});
    
## What else is in there?

Good practices for overall productivity, code maintanability, ease-of-debugging and most of all keeping it simple as possible but ready for scaling.

- _Comments_: preaching commenting your code by example.
- Localization using the [RequireJS i18n plugin](https://github.com/requirejs/i18n) for it's simplicity, see the [Localization](https://github.com/josimard/angular-requirejs-seed/blob/master/app/js/services/Localization.js) module.
- [Dynamic routing](https://github.com/josimard/angular-requirejs-seed/blob/master/app/js/services/Routing.js): to handle more cases, flexibility, route localization and page title changes, etc.
- A simple ASYNC [boot](https://github.com/josimard/angular-requirejs-seed/blob/master/app/boot.js) procedure triggered by RequireJS.
